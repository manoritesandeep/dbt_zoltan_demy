# DBT Bootcamp: Zero to Hero (Student Project)

This repository contains my work from **The Complete dbt (Data Build Tool) Bootcamp: Zero to Hero**, where I learned dbt from scratch through theory and hands-on practice with a **real-world Airbnb analytics project**.

## What I Learned

* Core concepts: Analytics Engineering, Modern Data Stack, ETL vs. ELT, Slowly Changing Dimensions, Data Maturity Models.
* dbt fundamentals: models, materializations, tests, sources, seeds, snapshots, documentation, macros, hooks, packages, and orchestration.
* Project workflow: building and maintaining a complete dbt project in Snowflake, with environment setup for Mac/Windows and IDE/dbt extensions.
* Advanced practices: debugging, Great Expectations integration, exposures, and data visualization with Preset.

## Project Focus

The practical part of the course centered on building a dbt project for **Airbnb** data, simulating how dbt is used in industry. Each step mirrored real-world data engineering and analytics workflows, from raw sources to analytics-ready datasets.

## Why This Repo

This repo documents my progress, exercises, and learnings as I advanced from **beginner â†’ dbt practitioner**. By completing this project, I gained both **theoretical grounding** and **hands-on experience** with dbt in a modern data stack context.
